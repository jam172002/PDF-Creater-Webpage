1. Install Required Software

2. Open the Project in VS Code
✅ Copy the whole project folder to your new PC.

✅ Open it in VS Code:

Backend depends on some npm packages.

✅ Open Terminal inside VS Code, then go inside your backend folder:


cd backend
▶️ npm install
This will install:

express

mongoose

cors

(Automatically, based on package.json)

✅ No need to manually install each library — npm install does it.

✅ Open Command Prompt or Terminal and run:

▶️ mongod
(make sure you have C:\data\db folder created, if not, create it again.)

✅ MongoDB will start:
"Waiting for connections on port 27017"

5. Start Backend Server
✅ Open a NEW terminal window (because MongoDB should stay running).

Go inside backend/ folder again, then:

▶️ node server.js
✅ Should print:

MongoDB Connected
Server running on port 5000
6. Serve Frontend
✅ Go to your frontend/ folder:

cd ../frontend
✅ If you already installed live-server globally:

▶️ live-server
If not installed:

▶️ npm install -g live-server
▶️ live-server
✅ Browser will automatically open http://127.0.0.1:5500

✅ Fill the form ➔ Submit ➔ Save to MongoDB ➔ Auto-generate PDF.
